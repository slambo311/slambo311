I'm a tech geek. I'm somewhat experienced in the Source Engine. You want a bind? Just ask me by making an issue on one of my repositories, preferably on this [readme repo](https://github.com/slambo311/slambo311) or [miscellaneous](https://github.com/slambo311/miscellaneous).

I have ADHD, so I sometimes have trouble focusing, and get distracted easily.

If I were to compare myself to any Valve character, I'm sometimes laid-back and calm like Engineer, sometimes I'm sick of everyone's crap like Spy, and sometimes I have no clue what I'm doing and make terrible choices, like Soldier.

Stuff I can do in game-related projects: 

* Random ideas (From really stupid ideas to decent ideas)

* Concept art, I guess? Just give me an idea of what character/object you want. 

* Making terrible jokes

* Voice acting

   * I can do like 50 different impressions. All TF2 classes (yes, even Pyro), HL2 citizens, HL1 scientists, Portal 2 Defective turrets, Cave Johnson, and much more.
