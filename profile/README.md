I'm a tech geek. I'm experienced in the Source Engine. Mainly SFM.

I have ADHD. Basically, it means I sometimes have trouble focusing, and get distracted easily.

If I were to compare myself to any Valve character, I'm sometimes laid-back and calm like Engineer, sometimes I'm sick of everyone's crap like Spy, and sometimes I have no clue what I'm doing and make terrible choices, like Soldier.

Usefulness in Source Engine-related projects: 

* Ideas and suggestions for new stuff

* Concept art

* Making terrible jokes

* Voice acting

   * I can do like 50 different impressions. All TF2 classes (yes, even Pyro), HL2 citizens, HL1 scientists, Portal 2 Defective turrets, Cave Johnson, and much more. 

* Finding bugs
