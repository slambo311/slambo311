I'm a tech geek. I'm experienced in the Source Engine. Mainly SFM.

I have ADHD. Basically, it means I sometimes have trouble focusing, and get distracted easily.

If I were to compare myself to any Valve character, I'm sometimes laid-back and calm like Engineer, sometimes I'm sick of everyone's crap like Spy, and sometimes I have no clue what I'm doing and make terrible choices, like Soldier.

Usefulness in Source-related projects: 
Ideas and suggestions for new stuff
Finding bugs, I guess?
Concept art (I'm pretty good at drawing)
Being that one guy that does almost nothing productive
Making terrible jokes
