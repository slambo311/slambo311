I'm a tech geek. I'm experienced in the Source Engine, 3D modelling, coding, "tech support", and more.

If you've got a computer problem or suggestion for something for me to do, then just make an issue on https://github.com/McStonks/Ask-me-stuff

Also, I have ADHD. Basically, it means I sometimes have trouble focusing. For some reason, there's a side effect of making me creative, though.

I talk way too much, even online. I can't even count how many times I've been told to shut up.
